== Goal == 
To develop a framework of scripts that can read in pcap data (e.g. pdml) and output security scripts for use in bug hunting. 

== To Do ==
- ***Add support for pdml with multiple frames***
- Create script to output python http.requests from http pdml data
- Develop initial script
- Add check to output where "missing" bytes are

== Known Bugs ==
- If the wireshark dissector does not add the value into the field then it will be missing from the output. 

== Example Usage ==
The following example is how to create a sulley fuzzing file from giop traffic. 

1. Record traffic from BusinessObjects including CORBA traffic. This has been saved as pcap_samples/giop_sdk.pcap
2. Parse the traffic to one frame, storing it as a PDML file:

$. tshark -T pdml -r pcap_samples/giop_sdk.pcap "frame.number == 24" > pdml_samples/single_giop.pd
ml

This file is stored as pdml_samples/single_giop.pdml

3. Use stinkbug to output the sulley stub:

$. python stinkbug.py --sulley pdml_samples/single_giop.pdml
